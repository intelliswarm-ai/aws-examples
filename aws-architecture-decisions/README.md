# AWS Architectural Trade-offs & Decision Trees

A collection of decision diagrams to help architects make informed choices when designing AWS solutions. Each diagram maps **keywords/requirements** to **services** with clear reasoning for eliminations.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **Identify the requirement** from stakeholders (cost, performance, availability, etc.)
2. **Find the relevant decision tree** below
3. **Follow the flowchart** based on your specific constraints
4. **Apply elimination rules** to validate your choice

## Quick Reference: The 5 Trade-off Questions

Every architectural decision secretly asks one of these:

| Priority | Signal Keywords | Typical AWS Bias |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Lowest Cost** | "cost-effective", "minimize cost" | Spot, S3, serverless |
| **Highest Availability** | "highly available", "fault tolerant" | Multi-AZ, Global |
| **Lowest Latency** | "real-time", "milliseconds" | Caching, edge, in-memory |
| **Easiest to Manage** | "least operational overhead" | Managed services, serverless |
| **Most Secure** | "compliance", "audit", "encrypt" | KMS, IAM, private endpoints |

## Decision-Making Approach

For every architectural decision, follow this approach:

```
1. Identify the goal (what problem are we solving?)
2. Identify the constraint (cost/HA/latency/ops/security)
3. Match keywords to services
4. Eliminate options using elimination rules
5. Pick managed > serverless > scalable
```

> **Architectural principle:** Choose the simplest managed service that meets ALL stated constraints.

---

## Meta-Patterns

### The AWS Architecture Bias

> When AWS provides a **fully managed**, **native**, or **serverless** option — that is almost always the correct answer.

### The Simplicity Rule

> Choose the **simplest managed service** that meets the constraint, not the most flexible one.

### The Compatibility Rule

> "Minimal refactor" usually means **stay within the same ecosystem** (Aurora → Aurora Global, not DynamoDB).

## Adding New Decision Trees

This structure is extensible. To add a new decision tree:

1. Create a new file in `diagrams/` following the [TEMPLATE.md](./diagrams/TEMPLATE.md)
2. Add an entry to the index table above
3. Include at minimum:
   - Decision flowchart (Mermaid)
   - Keyword → Service mapping table
   - Elimination rules
   - Real-world examples

---

## Source

These decision trees are synthesized from:
- AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Production architecture reviews
- AWS best practices and service documentation
